/*
 
 To make a global object, add <RPSingleton> protocol in class interface
 and call RPSingletonize(); in class implementation.
 
 From then on, every instance of the class will be the very same object.
 
 You can create new pointers to the global object the following ways:
 - obj = [[YourClass alloc] init];
 - obj = [YourClass new];
 - obj = YourClass.s;
 - by adding an object to a Nib file
 
 Best of all: you can have the object instances in _many_ Nib files and it will be the same object.
 You can even hook its outlets from different Nibs or have other Nib objects set up target/action pairs
 with it and it will all just work.
 
 PS. The +s method is just a convenience for +new as it's just much nicer to type in long message chains.

 The problem with RPSingletonize() is that even though every instance is the same,
 each time +s/+new is called, -init is also called.
 
 To make sure the object is only initialized once, instead of definining -init,
 use RP_InitOnce macro in class implementation like so:
 
 RP_InitOnce(
 {
     // (your initialization code)
 });
 
 Note that you don't have to write `if(self = [super init])` or `return self`.
 It just works.
